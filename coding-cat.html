                        <p>This piece came to me while I was learning to code for one of my computing courses at NUS. I wanted to capture the sense of frustration when you write a piece of code only for the program to give you an error. In the artwork, an innocent orange cat toils away at the computer under the cover of darkness, only to face the harsh reality that its work has coding errors. It is a lighthearted reflection of a common experience that every new programmers must come to accept — you will inevitably have bugs when writing code.</p>

                        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                        <p>The initial spark for this piece was the frustration I felt while learning to code, fixing bug after bug while hoping my program would finally run. The truth is that even the most experienced developers struggle with bugs because writing software that is both correct and simple is really difficult. As computer scientist C. A. R. Hoare once said:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>“There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.”</p>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>With this piece, I also wanted to challenge myself by creating my first animation. The idea was for the cat to type on the keyboard, then pause as an error message pops up, further conveying the core experience of the piece.</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <div class="center-horizontally">
                            <img class="process-img" src="images/Coding_Cat_Process.png" alt="Three overlapping Procreate app screenshots showing the progression of 'Coding Cat': a rough sketch on top, line art in the middle, and the final coloured version at the bottom.">
                        </div>
                        <p>Using Procreate, I first sketched and did the line art of the piece. I chose a retro CRT computer because of its iconic look that's easily recognisable as a computer. I also drew the character as a kitten to make the piece lighthearted and visually pleasing.</p>
                        <p>For the colouring, I used blue to symbolise the high-tech feel of programming. I chose white for the computer screen's reflection on the floor to contrast with the dark blue background. This helps to show that the scene is set in a dimly-lit environment and makes the cat's shadows stand out. The floor's reflection also subtly includes the words “Error.” and “Help!” to convey a feeling of struggle to observant viewers.</p>
                        <div class="center-horizontally">
                            <img class="reflection-img" src="images/Coding_Cat_Reflection.png" alt="The orange cat typing at the computer seen through a circular opening, with the computer screen's light blue glow reflecting on the floor over a dark blue background.">
                        </div>
                        <p>Finally, I animated the piece by drawing multiple versions of the cat's hands typing on the keyboard. The animation starts off with pink colours as the cat types, then shifts to blue when it encounters an error. This reflects a change in mood from the enjoyment of coding to the frustration of errors.</p>

                        <p>My favourite part of this piece is the reflection of the light on the floor. It took quite a long time to get it right but I feel that it gave the piece a unique look. As for the animation, I realised that the cat's hand movement felt slightly choppy due to the limited number of in-between frames. It taught me to look more closely at which frames are essential to create smoother animations.</p>
                        <p>For some time now, I've been exploring cartoonish art styles, but I think I feel ready to try something new, like pixel art or realism. I'm curious to see how my style evolves as I experiment more.</p>
